<div align="justify">
I'm Nicola, a <b>Data Engineer</b> living in Berlin.
<br><br>
My knowledge focus on various programming languages, but I’m working mostly with Python and SQL to
implement ETL processes, that depending on the amount of data, can run in one Worker or in a Spark
Cluster with many nodes. In this year I focused on distributed systems to process a huge amount of data, e.g.
Spark, but also distribute storages or SQL engines like Presto or ElasticSearch. I’m a big fan of AWS, and all
their services, why maintain a Kafka Cluster with ZooKeeper if you can easily setup a Kinesis Stream with
a flexible number of shards based on the number of producers? I like to maintain the AWS Infrastructure
using tools like Cloudformation or Teraform. This is not simply writing config files, but involves using tested
and proven software development practices e.g: version control, testing, small deployments, design patterns.
